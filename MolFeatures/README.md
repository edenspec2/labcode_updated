## Implementation Details

### Computational Methods in Depth
#### R² Calculation
The R² (coefficient of determination) is calculated using the following formula:
```
R² = 1 - (SSres / SStot)
```
Where SSres is the residual sum of squares and SStot is the total sum of squares.

#### Statistical Analysis Approaches
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Used for dimensionality reduction and identification of key features
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are computed to identify relationships between molecular features
- **Outlier Detection**: Uses modified Z-score method to identify potential outliers in feature datasets

#### Optimization Techniques
- **Grid Search**: Used for hyperparameter optimization
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Employed for conformational search and feature selection
- **Simulated Annealing**: Utilized for global optimization problems

### Feature Extraction Details

Implementation uses Fourier transform to analyze vibrational frequencies within ring structures:
- Frequency range: 500-1700 cm⁻¹
- Resolution: 2 cm⁻¹
- Normalization: Min-max scaling

#### Stretch Vibration Analysis
Captures bond stretching between atoms:
- C-H stretching: 2850-3100 cm⁻¹
- C=O stretching: 1650-1800 cm⁻¹
- O-H stretching: 3200-3650 cm⁻¹

#### Sterimol Parameter Calculation
Computes Verloop's Sterimol parameters:
- B₁: Minimum width perpendicular to the primary axis
- B₅: Maximum width perpendicular to the primary axis
- L: Length along the primary axis
