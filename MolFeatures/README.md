Loading Data: Users can browse and load molecular data files with ease, you can use it too choose with the "Browse for Feather Files Directory" button the feather files directory to load them as Molecule object for feature extraction.

Data Management: The application offers options to filter molecules, select working directories, and even create new directories for organized data storage.

Molecular Conversion: With a simple click, users can convert smiles strings to XYZ file formats, facilitating the interchange between different molecular representation standards.

Data Analysis: The tool allows the production of computation sets and extraction of DataFrames and input files for ML.
Visualization: Users can visualize molecules.
File Creation: The application supports creating .com files, and choose basis set, functional and so on.

Comp Set Application:

Ring Vibration atoms: Users can enter atom indices following a specific order of atoms in ring vibrations (p,primary,o,o,m,m).

Stretch Vibration atoms: This input field allows users to specify atom pairs connected by a common atom for stretch vibration analysis.

Bending Vibration atoms: In this section, users can input atom pairs to examine their bending vibrations.

Dipole atoms: Atom indices entered here are used for coordination transformation analysis, likely to calculate dipole moments.

NBO Difference: Users can input atom indices to show Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) calculations or atom pairs to calculate differences in NBO.

Sterimol atoms: This field is dedicated to entering atom indices to calculate Sterimol parameters along the primary axis.

Bond length: Here, users can input pairs of atoms to calculate and compare bond lengths.

Bond Angle: Users can insert a list of atom triads or quartets to calculate angles or dihedrals.

At the bottom of the window, there are buttons to "Submit" the entered data for processing, "Save input/output" for record-keeping, and "Load input" to retrieve previously saved parameters.
